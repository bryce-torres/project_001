This is the first project I'll be doing in order to learn data science more comprehensively.

From this project, I accomplished the following:
- I downloaded VSCode on my computer
- I created a "project_001" folder for this project in the Documents folder
- I downloaded a dataset as a csv file from Kaggle into the folder

- I installed the Github extension on VSCode
- I authenticated the access
- I created the project_001 repository
- I pushed the first commit with the dataset

- I downloaded Python on my computer
- I downloaded the pandas library on my computer with pip install pandas
- I installed the Jupyter Notebook extension on VSCode
- I installed a Jupyter kernel
- I created a notebook file
- I pushed this commit to the repo

- I wrote a README.md file
- I fetched the file from origin into VSCode
